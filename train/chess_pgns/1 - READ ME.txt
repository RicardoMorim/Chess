This is a collection of lichess.org games from https://database.lichess.org/

I filtered all (standard) games from https://database.lichess.org/ to only keep games by players 
rated 2400+ against players rated 2200+, excluding bullet games.

I believe that it might be useful for players who want to be up to date on the latest theoretical 
novelties as strong players test their discoveries online. Another potential use for this database 
is to see how strong opponents would face your openings in practice.

********** FAQ **********

Q: How to use these files?
A: Import them into the database software of your choice such as chessbase or scid. I have tested 
the files with scid but not with any other software.

Q: Why aren't the clock times included?
A: To save space.

Q: Why aren't the URLs of the games included?
A: lichess stores the URLs of the games in the "Site" tag. Unfortunately scid has a limit on the 
number of different sites which can be stored in a database which is reached pretty fast if each 
game has its own site. I decided to delete the URLs to be able to use the files in scid.

Q: Why would I need to download this database if the lichess explorer has the same games?
A: The lichess explorer is great for ad-hoc checking where you went wrong in a game but its inherent 
restrictions (currently you can only see the top 4 games in a particular position) doesn't make it 
as useful as a downloadable database for in-depth opening and middlegame preparation.

Q: I have a comment or suggestion - how do I contact you?
A: Feel free to message me at https://lichess.org/@/nikonoel

Q: These files only go to May 2020. How do I get the following months/years?
A: I will makes sure to include a link to the latest files on my lichess profile.
